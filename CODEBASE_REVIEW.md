# TheSet Codebase Review - Detailed Overview

## Executive Summary

TheSet is a concert setlist voting platform that has made significant progress toward the outlined goals. The core infrastructure is in place with React/TypeScript/Vite frontend, Supabase backend, and most API integrations completed. However, several key features and optimizations still need implementation.

## Tech Stack Analysis

### ‚úÖ **Completed Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and Vite (as specified)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI components 
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (not Neon as originally planned)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with Spotify OAuth
- **State Management**: React Query for data fetching
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime implemented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tech Stack Differences**
- Using **Supabase PostgreSQL** instead of Neon PostgreSQL
- **No Drizzle ORM** - using direct Supabase client
- **Deployment**: Setup for standard deployment, not specifically Vercel Edge Functions
- **No Vercel Cron Jobs** configured - background sync happens in-browser

## Database Schema Review

All required tables from the specification are implemented:
- `users` - User profiles with Spotify integration
- `artists` - Artist information from Spotify
- `venues` - Venue information from Ticketmaster  
- `shows` - Concert/show information
- `songs` - Song catalog for artists
- `setlists` - Fan-created setlists
- `setlist_songs` - Songs in setlists with vote counts
- `votes` - Individual user votes
- `played_setlists` - Actual performed setlists
- `played_setlist_songs` - Songs in performed setlists
- `user_artists` - User's followed/favorite artists
