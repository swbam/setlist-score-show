# TheSet - Complete Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ One-Command Deployment

TheSet now includes a comprehensive deployment script that handles everything in one command:

```bash
pnpm updateall
```

This single command will:
1. âœ… Set Supabase secrets from your `.env` file
2. âœ… Run all database migrations
3. âœ… Deploy all Supabase functions
4. âœ… Trigger initial data syncs
5. âœ… Build the entire application
6. âœ… Commit and push all changes to git
7. âœ… Deploy web app to Vercel (if configured)
8. âœ… Deploy API to Railway (if configured)

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

Before running `pnpm updateall`, ensure you have:

### Required Tools
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager
- [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Optional Tools (for automatic deployment)
- [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) - for web app deployment
- [Railway CLI](https://railway.app/cli) - for API deployment

### Environment Setup

1. **Create `.env` file** in the project root with your API keys:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key

# API Keys
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-spotify-client-id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-spotify-client-secret
TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=your-ticketmaster-api-key
SETLIST_FM_API_KEY=your-setlistfm-api-key

# Security
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
```

2. **Initialize Supabase** (if not already done):
```bash
supabase login
supabase init
supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
```

3. **Configure Git** (if not already done):
```bash
git remote add origin your-repository-url
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage

### Full Deployment
```bash
pnpm updateall
```

## ðŸ”§ Individual Commands

If you need to run specific parts of the deployment process:

### Database Operations
```bash
# Run migrations only
pnpm db:migrate:deploy

# Seed database
pnpm db:seed
```

### Function Management
```bash
# Deploy all functions manually
cd supabase/functions && ./deploy-all.sh
```

### Data Syncing
```bash
# Run specific syncs
pnpm refresh:trending
pnpm jobs:sync
```

### Building
```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Development mode
pnpm dev
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Supabase CLI not authenticated**
   ```bash
   supabase login
   ```

2. **Missing environment variables**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists with all required variables
   - Check that variables are properly formatted (no spaces around `=`)

3. **Git push fails**
   - Ensure you have push permissions to the repository
   - Check if remote origin is set: `git remote -v`

4. **Function deployment fails**
   - Verify Supabase project is linked: `supabase status`
   - Check function code for syntax errors

5. **Build failures**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
   - Check for TypeScript errors: `pnpm type-check`

### Getting Help

If the deployment script fails:

1. **Check the colored output** - errors are shown in red with specific details
2. **Review logs** - each step shows detailed information about what went wrong
3. **Run individual commands** - isolate the failing step and run it manually
4. **Verify prerequisites** - ensure all required tools are installed and configured

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Deployment

For automated deployments, you can:

1. **Set up GitHub Actions** to run `pnpm updateall` on push to main
2. **Use webhooks** to trigger deployments from external services
3. **Schedule regular deployments** using cron jobs

### Example GitHub Action

```yaml
name: Deploy TheSet
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm install -g pnpm
      - run: pnpm install
      - run: pnpm updateall
        env:
          SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          # Add other secrets as needed
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- **Supabase Dashboard** - Check function logs and database health
- **Vercel Dashboard** - Monitor web app performance and deployments
- **Railway Dashboard** - Check API health and logs
- **Application Logs** - Review sync job success/failure rates

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!

Once `pnpm updateall` completes successfully, your TheSet application is fully deployed and ready for users!

The homepage will show:
- âœ… Top trending artists with upcoming shows
- âœ… Upcoming concerts with proper venue information
- âœ… Functional search for artists and locations
- âœ… Real-time voting capabilities
- âœ… Admin panel for manual sync triggers

Your concert setlist voting platform is now live! ðŸŽµ
