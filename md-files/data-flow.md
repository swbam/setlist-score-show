Below is a thorough overview explaining the best way to implement data handling in your app, *TheSet*, focusing on when to use APIs directly versus relying on your database, and when to import data from APIs versus using existing database data. This approach is designed to be efficient, scalable, and responsive, addressing the issues you've identified while aligning with your app's initial outline. I'll break it down into clear steps and paragraphs for each key component of the app.

**Step 1: Artist Discovery and Search**

When users search for artists using the search bar, the app should query the **Ticketmaster API** directly. This ensures that only artists with upcoming shows are displayed, reflecting real-time availability. Fetching directly from the API is critical here because show schedules can change frequently, and relying on outdated database data could lead to inaccuracies. For example, if an artist cancels a tour, the database might not reflect this unless updated via the API.

* **Implementation:** Use the Ticketmaster API endpoint (/api/ticketmaster/events) to fetch artists based on the search term. Implement **debouncing** on the search input (e.g., wait 300ms after the user stops typing) to minimize API calls and improve performance.  
* **Database Role:** Once an artist is selected from the search results, cache their basic details (e.g., name, Ticketmaster ID, image) in the artists table. This speeds up subsequent loads of the artist's profile page. However, the search itself should always hit the API for freshness.  
* **Data Import Timing:** Import artist data into the database only when a user selects an artist from the search results and the artist isn’t already in the artists table.

This resolves your issue of the **artist search not working** by ensuring a direct, reliable connection to the Ticketmaster API rather than relying on potentially stale or incomplete database data.

**Step 2: Artist Profile Page**

After selecting an artist, the user lands on the artist’s profile page, which displays basic artist info and a list of upcoming concerts. Here, a hybrid approach of APIs and database caching is optimal.

* **Artist Details:** Fetch artist details (bio, image, genres) from the **Spotify API** (/api/spotify/artist/\[id\]) each time the page loads to ensure freshness, as this data can change (e.g., updated bio or new images). However, cache these details in the artists table with a **TTL of 7 days**. If the cached data is less than 7 days old, use it to reduce API calls; otherwise, refresh it from Spotify.  
* **Upcoming Concerts:** Pull concert data from the **Ticketmaster API** (/api/ticketmaster/events) to guarantee accuracy (e.g., cancellations or new shows). Cache this data in the shows table with a **TTL of 24 hours**. If the cache is fresh, serve it; otherwise, fetch anew.  
* **Implementation:** Use Next.js **server-side rendering (SSR)** to fetch and cache this data on the server. This reduces client-side load times and ensures a seamless experience.  
* **Data Import Timing:** Import artist details when a user first visits the profile or if the cached data is stale (older than 7 days). Import show data when the artist is added or when a user visits the profile, refreshing it if older than 24 hours.

This approach ensures a polished, up-to-date artist page while leveraging the database for efficiency.

**Step 3: Show Page and Setlist Creation**

When a user clicks a concert card, they’re taken to the show page, displaying venue details, date, ticket links, and the interactive setlist. This is where your issue of **disconnected shows, setlists, and setlist\_songs** arises, and we’ll fix it with a clear data flow.

* **Show Details:** Fetch from the **Ticketmaster API** (/api/ticketmaster/events) to ensure the latest info (e.g., rescheduling or venue changes). Cache in the shows table with a 24-hour TTL, using the database if fresh.  
* **Setlist Creation:** When the show page is first accessed, check the setlists table for an existing setlist (linked to the show\_id). If none exists, create one in the database:  
  1. Fetch the artist’s song catalog from the **Spotify API** (/api/spotify/artist/\[id\]/top-tracks) if not already in the top\_tracks table.  
  2. Store the catalog in top\_tracks.  
  3. Randomly select 5 songs from this catalog, insert them into the setlist\_songs table with votes set to 0, and link them to a new setlists entry.  
* **Database Role:** The setlists and setlist\_songs tables store this data persistently. The top\_tracks table caches the artist’s catalog, fetched once and reused unless the artist’s catalog needs updating (rarely, as voting drives setlist evolution).  
* **Implementation:** Trigger setlist creation on the first page load via a server-side API call. Use Drizzle ORM to insert into setlists and setlist\_songs tables atomically.  
* **Data Import Timing:** Import show details when the page loads (cache if fresh). Import tracks when creating the setlist (fetch from Spotify only if top\_tracks is empty for that artist).

This fixes your issues: **setlists not being created** when a show page loads and **setlists not using 5 random songs** from the catalog with zero votes initially.

**Step 4: Voting System**

The voting system allows users to upvote songs, updating counts in real-time. This relies heavily on the database for persistence and consistency.

* **Data Source:** Store votes in the votes table (tracking user votes) and update setlist\_songs.votes for the aggregate count. Use the database exclusively here—no API is needed for vote storage.  
* **Implementation:** When a user votes:  
  1. Check the votes table to enforce one vote per user per song (via unique constraint).  
  2. Insert the vote and increment setlist\_songs.votes in a transaction.  
  3. Use **WebSockets** (e.g., Pusher) to broadcast the updated vote count to all users on the page.  
* **Efficiency:** Implement **optimistic UI updates**—increment the vote count locally before server confirmation, reverting if the request fails. This makes voting feel instantaneous.  
* **Data Import Timing:** No API imports here; all data is user-generated and stored in the database.

This ensures a robust, real-time voting experience with vote integrity maintained.

**Step 5: User Authentication and Personalization**

Users log in via Spotify OAuth, expecting a personalized dashboard with artists they follow or listen to. Your issue of **Spotify sign-in not redirecting to the dashboard** suggests a Next Auth configuration problem.

* **Authentication:** Use **Spotify OAuth** via Next Auth. On login, store the user’s Spotify ID and basic profile (name, email, image) in the users table.  
* **Personalized Data:** Fetch the user’s followed artists or top artists from the **Spotify API** (/api/spotify/me/following or /api/spotify/me/top/artists) each time the dashboard loads for freshness, as preferences can shift.  
* **Database Role:** Cache the user’s top artists in the database (e.g., a user\_artists table) with a **TTL of 1 hour** to reduce API calls, but allow a manual refresh option.  
* **Implementation:** Fix the redirect by setting pages.signIn in Next Auth to redirect to /profile (or your dashboard route) after login. Fetch personalized data server-side and render it.  
* **Data Import Timing:** Import user profile data on first login. Fetch personalized artist data on each dashboard load, caching briefly.

This resolves the redirect issue and enhances personalization.

**Step 6: Homepage and Artists Page**

The homepage and /artists page should showcase trending shows and popular artists, addressing your concern about them lacking polish.

* **Trending Shows:** Query the shows and setlist\_songs tables to identify shows with high voting activity (e.g., sum of votes). Use the database here, as it holds all vote data.  
* **Popular Artists:** Fetch popularity metrics from the **Spotify API** (/api/spotify/artist/\[id\]) periodically (e.g., daily) and cache in the artists table. Serve from the database unless stale.  
* **Implementation:** Use SSR to pre-fetch this data, rendering a polished UI with featured sections (e.g., “Hot Shows,” “Top Artists”). Add a hero section explaining *TheSet*.  
* **Data Import Timing:** Import popularity data daily via a background job. Use existing vote data from the database for trending shows.

This makes your homepage and artists page more engaging and robust.

**Step 7: Data Import and Sync Strategy**

To address your concern about **underutilized import features**, here’s when and how to import data:

* **Artists (Ticketmaster API):**  
  * **When:** User searches for an artist not in the database.  
  * **Data:** Name, ID, image.  
  * **Sync:** Refresh every 7 days or on manual trigger.  
* **Shows (Ticketmaster API):**  
  * **When:** User visits an artist’s profile or artist is added.  
  * **Data:** Name, date, venue ID, ticket URL, image.  
  * **Sync:** Refresh every 24 hours or on page visit if stale.  
* **Venues (Ticketmaster API):**  
  * **When:** Imported with show data.  
  * **Data:** Name, city, state, country, address.  
  * **Sync:** Update when new show data includes the venue.  
* **Tracks (Spotify API):**  
  * **When:** Setlist creation for a show (if top\_tracks is empty).  
  * **Data:** Track name, ID, Spotify URL.  
  * **Sync:** Fetch once; no frequent updates needed.  
* **Database Usage:**  
  * Store all user-generated data (votes, setlists) directly.  
  * Cache API data (artists, shows, venues, tracks) for efficiency.

This ensures a seamless import/sync flow from Ticketmaster and Spotify.

**Summary of Efficient Data Flow**

* **Search and Discovery:** Always use the Ticketmaster API for real-time accuracy.  
* **Artist and Show Pages:** Fetch from APIs for freshness, cache in the database for speed.  
* **Setlists and Voting:** Store in the database, update in real-time with WebSockets.  
* **Personalization:** Fetch from Spotify API for dynamic user data, cache briefly.  
* **Homepage and Artists Page:** Use database for trending data, cache periodic API imports.

This strategy minimizes API calls, ensures data freshness where it matters, and leverages your Neon PostgreSQL database for performance and persistence, resolving all identified issues while adhering to your app’s outline.
