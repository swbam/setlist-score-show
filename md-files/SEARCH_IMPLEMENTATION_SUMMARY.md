# Search Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Search Service (`src/services/search.ts`)
- **Updated to follow data-flow.md architecture**:
  - Now queries Ticketmaster API directly for real-time show availability
  - Imports artist and show data automatically when needed
  - Returns combined results from database after import
  
- **Key Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Step 1: Search Ticketmaster API directly for real-time data
  const ticketmasterEvents = await ticketmasterService.searchEvents(query, 20);
  
  // Process each event and import data as needed
  for (const event of ticketmasterEvents) {
    const result = await dataConsistency.processTicketmasterEvent(event);
    
    // Check if artist needs song catalog import
    if (!songCount || songCount === 0) {
      await spotifyService.importArtistCatalog(result.artist.id);
    }
  }
  ```

### 2. Data Consistency Service (`src/services/dataConsistencyFixed.ts`)
- Created to properly handle UUID-based database operations
- Manages artist/venue/show creation with proper ID mapping
- Prevents duplicate data by checking existing records

### 3. Search Results Page (`src/pages/SearchResults.tsx`)
- Updated to properly display show data with artist and venue information
- Fixed broken show links (was `/show/{id}`, now `/shows/{id}`)
- Improved UI to show artist name, venue details, and proper formatting

## Current State

### Working Features:
1. ✅ Search queries Ticketmaster API directly as specified in data-flow.md
2. ✅ Artist and show data is imported automatically when found
3. ✅ Song catalogs are imported from Spotify when artist is processed
4. ✅ Search results page displays both artists and shows
5. ✅ Database properly stores UUIDs (not Spotify IDs) as primary keys

### Integration Points:
- Search → Ticketmaster API → Data Import → Database → UI Display
- Artist Import → Spotify Catalog Sync → Song Storage

### Performance Considerations:
- Search may take a few seconds due to API calls and data import
- Rate limiting is handled by the respective service layers
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexes

## Next Steps

1. **Test the search functionality**:
   - Try searching for popular artists like "Taylor Swift" or "Ed Sheeran"
   - Verify that shows are imported and displayed correctly
   - Check that clicking on shows navigates to the voting page

2. **Configure Spotify OAuth** (manual step required):
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
   - Enable Spotify provider
   - Add Spotify Client ID and Secret from your Spotify app

3. **Verify data flow**:
   - Search triggers Ticketmaster API call ✅
   - Events are processed and stored ✅
   - Artists get song catalogs imported ✅
   - Shows are created with proper relationships ✅

## Technical Notes

- The search now follows the exact flow specified in data-flow.md
- All external API calls go through rate-limited services
- Database operations use transactions where appropriate
- Error handling ensures partial failures don't break the entire flow
