# Product Context - TheSet Platform

## Why TheSet Exists

### The Problem We're Solving

**Music fans are disconnected from the concert experience.** Current live music engagement is passive - fans buy tickets, show up, and hope their favorite songs get played. There's no way for the community to collectively express what they want to hear, and no way to measure how well artists connect with fan desires.

### The Gap in the Market

- **No Fan Influence**: Fans have zero input on what songs get performed
- **Disconnected Experience**: No bridge between streaming preferences and live shows  
- **Missed Community**: No platform for collective music discovery around live events
- **No Prediction Game**: No way to gamify the concert experience

### Our Solution

TheSet creates the first **participatory concert prediction platform** where fans collectively build ideal setlists for upcoming shows, then compare their predictions with reality. It's part social platform, part prediction game, part concert discovery tool.

## How TheSet Should Work

### Core User Experience

#### Discovery Phase
1. **Homepage**: User sees trending shows and top artists with upcoming concerts
2. **Search**: Unified search for artists (by name) or shows (by location/zip code)
3. **Artist Profiles**: Show upcoming tour dates, past shows, fan voting statistics

#### Engagement Phase  
1. **Show Pages**: Interactive setlist voting for upcoming concerts
2. **Real-time Voting**: Live vote counts update as community participates
3. **Setlist Evolution**: Songs reorder based on vote popularity
4. **Social Pressure**: See how many others are voting, create urgency

#### Post-Concert Analysis
1. **Setlist Comparison**: Side-by-side fan prediction vs actual setlist
2. **Accuracy Scoring**: Individual and community prediction accuracy
3. **Community Recognition**: Leaderboards for best predictors
4. **Social Sharing**: Share prediction results on social media

### User Journey Flow

Compare Results → Build Reputation → Discover More Shows
```
