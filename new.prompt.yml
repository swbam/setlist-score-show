      review the codebase in this proiject for my concert setlist voting web app
      in this repo: https://github.com/swbam/setlist-score-show

      . revirew all codes, tables, fields, types, functions, package.json,
      config files thoroughly. 


      Review the fixes reccomendded in the folder "md-files". The CLAUDE-2.md is
      the top tier of fixes and then the CLAUDE.md is next in priority. your
      task is to write a new very detailed plan. Like 5x more detailed than
      these md files and actual code for each ciritical fix. This new outline
      should still include the app overview and purpose, the data flow, db
      architecutre, functions, cron jobs and all. dont add any new architecures
      unless explcoictly needed. write this as if youre giving the new outline
      to a devleloper who knows nothing about this app and needs to finalize it
      and get it 100% working with the data flow, sync etc
