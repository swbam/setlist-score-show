      review my entire codebase for my concert setlist voting web app. it has a
      lot of errors and features not fully built. if i were to rebuild this web
      app from scratch but use a starter template like
      https://www.next-forge.com/?ref=producthunt


      would this be template to use as a base? review their docs and codebase in
      the repo also, then provide an outline of pros and cons and how to
      implement using this template and with the features of my existing web
      app. https://github.com/vercel/next-forge
