# TheSet: Concert Setlist Voting Platform - Complete Analysis & Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**TheSet** is a fan-powered concert setlist voting platform that allows music fans to vote on songs they want to hear at upcoming concerts and compare fan-created setlists with actual performed setlists. The platform operates autonomously by integrating with Spotify for artist data and song catalogs, Ticketmaster for concert information, and setlist.fm for actual performed setlists after shows occur.

### Core Vision
TheSet transforms fans from passive spectators into active collaborators in the concert experience. Each upcoming concert becomes a fan-generated prediction game where fans vote on their ideal setlist ahead of the show, compare it with the actual setlist after the event, and earn credibility within the community for their accuracy.

## Conclusion

TheSet has a solid foundation with most core infrastructure completed. The main focus should be on completing the missing critical features (automatic setlist creation, show import pipeline, and setlist comparison) while fixing the identified issues. With the proposed 10-week implementation plan, TheSet can become a fully functional, production-ready platform that delivers on its vision of fan-powered concert experiences.

The platform's unique value proposition of combining predictive voting with post-show comparison creates a compelling user experience that doesn't exist in the current market. With proper execution of this plan, TheSet can establish itself as the go-to platform for concert fans who want to actively participate in shaping live music experiences.
